SETUP
=====
1. fix datasource connection in ispn.xml
2. run 'bash run.sh'


TEST SCENARIO
=============
1.) a cluster of 2 nodes
2.) key1 is written using jboss1 (key2/jboss2)
3.) key1 is changed using both servers (if step 2 succeeds)


ERROR FLAVORS
=============

1.) both keys on jboss2: initial entry of key1 did not succeed as the owner is jboss2

Results :

Failed tests:   persistJBoss1(SharedDistCacheTest): key1 was not persisted expected object to not be null
